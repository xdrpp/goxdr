		<p>The fiximports command fixes import declarations to use the canonical
import path for packages that have an &quot;import comment&quot; as defined by
<a href="https://golang.org/s/go14customimport">https://golang.org/s/go14customimport</a>.
<h3 id="hdr-Background">Background</h3>
<p>The Go 1 custom import path mechanism lets the maintainer of a
package give it a stable name by which clients may import and &quot;go
get&quot; it, independent of the underlying version control system (such
as Git) or server (such as github.com) that hosts it.  Requests for
the custom name are redirected to the underlying name.  This allows
packages to be migrated from one underlying server or system to
another without breaking existing clients.
<p>Because this redirect mechanism creates aliases for existing
packages, it&apos;s possible for a single program to import the same
package by its canonical name and by an alias.  The resulting
executable will contain two copies of the package, which is wasteful
at best and incorrect at worst.
<p>To avoid this, &quot;go build&quot; reports an error if it encounters a special
comment like the one below, and if the import path in the comment
does not match the path of the enclosing package relative to
GOPATH/src:
<pre>     $ grep ^package $GOPATH/src/github.com/bob/vanity/foo/foo.go
	package foo // import &quot;vanity.com/foo&quot;
</pre>
<p>The error from &quot;go build&quot; indicates that the package canonically
known as &quot;vanity.com/foo&quot; is locally installed under the
non-canonical name &quot;github.com/bob/vanity/foo&quot;.
<h3 id="hdr-Usage">Usage</h3>
<p>When a package that you depend on introduces a custom import comment,
and your workspace imports it by the non-canonical name, your build
will stop working as soon as you update your copy of that package
using &quot;go get -u&quot;.
<p>The purpose of the fiximports tool is to fix up all imports of the
non-canonical path within a Go workspace, replacing them with imports
of the canonical path.  Following a run of fiximports, the workspace
will no longer depend on the non-canonical copy of the package, so it
should be safe to delete.  It may be necessary to run &quot;go get -u&quot;
again to ensure that the package is locally installed under its
canonical path, if it was not already.
<p>The fiximports tool operates locally; it does not make HTTP requests
and does not discover new custom import comments.  It only operates
on non-canonical packages present in your workspace.
<p>The -baddomains flag is a list of domain names that should always be
considered non-canonical.  You can use this if you wish to make sure
that you no longer have any dependencies on packages from that
domain, even those that do not yet provide a canonical import path
comment.  For example, the default value of -baddomains includes the
moribund code hosting site code.google.com, so fiximports will report
an error for each import of a package from this domain remaining
after canonicalization.
<p>To see the changes fiximports would make without applying them, use
the -n flag.
